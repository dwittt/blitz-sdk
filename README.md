# **blitz-sdk**
blitz-sdk is a very beginner rage-cheat base/sdk that contains many similarities between popular csgo-cheat bases. this cheat uses [minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) for its hooking purposes in the game, and a slightly edited [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) system that allows developers to customize the menu to their liking. this sdk's legacy menu is inspired of off the popular, and private cheats such as [primordial](https://primordial.dev/) and [pandora](https://pandora.uno/).
